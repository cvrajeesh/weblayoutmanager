## LayoutManager ##

LayoutManager is a custom control which helps you to create a layout for web pages very easily with the same ease you did for windows forms.  It has good designer support, so that you donâ€™t need to write a single line of code. All things can be configured via the designer.

It is developed on top of the JQuery plugin http://www.rajeeshcv.com/projects/layoutmanager-jquery-plugin/
